# plotly-challenge

In this project, we were asked to take the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels, and create an interactive dashboard to explore said data using javascript and plotly.

There are three main visuals, and a sample of demografic information that change depending on the Subject Id that one chooses from the available dropdown. Those visuals are a horizontal bar graph, a bubble graph, and a gauge chart showing the washing frequency for each subject. 

I had a bit if trouble getting it to render, but that was because I had put the plotly and d3 scripts in the body of the html rather than the header. 

The only other strangeness, was the gauge chart. The one pictured in the example given was not the same as the link we were given to follow. I chose to follow the link which is called a guage chart, but i did discover that the other is a kind of pie chart with an indicator.
